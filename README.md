This C++ program is a simple Student Management System that allows users to manage student records. It provides functionality to add, display, update, and delete student details using a command-line interface. The program uses a `Student` class to encapsulate the student information and a `vector` to store multiple student records.

### Features:
1. **Add Student**: Enter student ID, name, age, and course to add a new student.
2. **Display Students**: View all students currently stored in the system.
3. **Update Student**: Modify the details of an existing student by providing their ID.
4. **Delete Student**: Remove a student from the system using their ID.
5. **Exit**: Terminate the program.

### Usage:
Run the program and follow the on-screen instructions to manage student records through the menu-driven interface.
